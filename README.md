# Rust Alternate Language Project
Alternative Language Project that sifts through a csv file using an alternative language other than C/C++/Python. This one is primarily focused on Rust

# Questions
### Which programming language and version did you pick?
I chose the Language Rust and the version I picked is 1.77.2
### Why did you pick this programming language?
I have always wondered about Rust and, given this opportunity, I decided to push myself to learn a completely new language rather than try and seek a language I have already dabbled in.
### How your programming language chosen handles: object-oriented programming, file ingestion, conditional statements, assignment statements, loops, subprograms (functions/methods), unit testing and exception handling. If one or more of these are not supported by your programming language, indicate it as so. 

### List out 3 libraries you used from your programming language (if applicable) and explain what they are, why you chose them and what you used them for.
Due to the fact that Rust is an alternative to C++ it utilizes the STD library as well which allows for easy usage in regards to opening files.
